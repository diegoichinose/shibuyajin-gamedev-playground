# WELCOME TO THE SHIBUYAJIN GAMEDEV PLAYGROUND

This project features a small slice of the source code of the game ["Enter The Night"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2624990/Enter_The_Night_Roguelite/) on Steam.
<br><br>
I'll be slowly adding new modules and improving this sandbox with cool reusable stuff.<br>
I hope you find something useful here!
